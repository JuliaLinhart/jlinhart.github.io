Hello!

I am a PhD Student at INRIA Saclay working under the supervision of [Alexandre Gramfort](https://alexandre.gramfort.net/) and [Pedro L. C. Rodrigues](https://plcrodrigues.github.io/) on simulation-based inference (SBI) and generative modelling.

The primary focus of my research has been on the use of deep generative models to address likelihood-free Bayesian inference tasks and their validation in terms of accuracy, efficiency and reliability. This work is motivated by the goal of efficiently inverting complex simulators from computational neuroscience and more generally to lift the remaining lack of trust for deep generative models to address important questions in experimental sciences.

My main projects include
- the development of new validation diagnostics for conditional deep generative models (e.g. Normalizing Flows, diffusion models, etc.) [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03580)[[2]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09602), with an integration to the official [`sbi`](https://github.com/sbi-dev/sbi) python package. This work was supported by my supervisors [Alexandre Gramfort](https://alexandre.gramfort.net/) and [Pedro L. C. Rodrigues](https://plcrodrigues.github.io/), [Gilles Louppe](https://glouppe.github.io/) and the [MACKELAB](https://www.mackelab.org/).
- the exploration of novel posterior sampling algorithms, for example based on diffusion models when one wishes to condition on multiple observations to get more precise estimations [[3]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07593). This is ongoing research in collaboration with [Sylvain Le Corff](https://sylvainlc.github.io/), [Gabriel V. Cardoso](https://gabrielvc.github.io/), [Marylou Gabri√©](https://marylou-gabrie.github.io/) and [Louis Grenioux](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eLpNKSEAAAAJ&hl=fr).

Before my PhD, I have also had the chance to work more closely on applications in ML for healthcare at two different start-ups, [Covera Health](https://www.coverahealth.com/) in New York (uncertainty quantification of Deep Learning models on MRIs) and [Owkin](https://www.owkin.com/) in Paris (development of Deep Learning models for breast cancer survival analysis on histology images and their calibration).

I am particularly interested in expanding my expertise on generative models and gaining a more profound understanding of their workings, my motivation being a mix of pure curiosity and my goal of applying them to aid experimental sciences.

Here is [my CV](). For more details, feel free to contact me at julia.linhart@inria.fr .
